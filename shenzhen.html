         <p>Shenzhen is a major sub-provincial city located on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. It forms part of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, bordering Hong Kong across the Sham Chun River to the south, Huizhou to the northeast and Dongguan to the northwest, and shares maritime boundaries with Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai to the west and southwest across the estuary.Shenzhen's cityscape results from its vibrant economy—made possible by rapid foreign investment following the institution of the policy of "reform and opening-up" in 1979.The city is a leading global technology hub, dubbed by media as the next Silicon Valley and China's Silicon Valley.It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s,and has been ranked second on the list "top 10 cities to visit in 2019" by Lonely Planet.Shenzhen, which roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao'an County, officially became a city in 1979, taking its name from the former county town, whose train station was the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway between Canton and Kowloon.In 1980, Shenzhen was established as China's first special econom zone.Shenzhen's registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000.However, local police and authorities estimate the actual population to be about 20 million, due to large populations of short-term residents,[a] unregistered floating migrants, part-time residents, commuters, visitors, as well as other temporary residents.Shenzhen hosts the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of numerous multinational companies such as JXD, Vanke, Hytera, CIMC, SF Express, Shenzhen Airlines, Nepstar, Hasee, Ping An Bank, Ping An Insurance, China Merchants Bank, Tencent, ZTE, OnePlus, Huawei, DJI and BYD.Shenzhen ranks 9th in the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index.It has the third busiest container port in the world.</p>
